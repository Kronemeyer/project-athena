    "### Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "In Task Two, we built Hybrid ensembles from the library of diverse types of weak defenses. By randomly selecting a combination of 20 different CNNs and SVMs weak defences, we ran Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Carlini - Wagner (CW), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks against 10 different sets of Hybrid ensembles on various machines’ hardware. Our experiment has shown that an ensemble with a ratio of more CNNs than SVMs yielded the most effective attacks. "

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we chose to modify the evaluation algorithm to randomly choose 20 different weak defences with variants of CNNs and SVMs. These defences were tested against the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Carlini - Wagner (CW), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Each of the 20 variants was run 10 times on various hardware to ensure the validity of the results. "

    "### Experimental settings \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Iterative Method (BIM) Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "The BIM Attacks are varied by epsilon strengths as used in our previous experiment. They increased by 20%. As the CNNs in the variants increase, the effectiveness of the attack increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Epsilon values use: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carlini - Wagner (CW) Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to our first experiment we chose to use the Linf configuration for the CW attacks. We held one variable as a constant and gradually increased the strength of the other variable. Just like the BIM attack, the effectiveness increased with the increase of CNNs to SVMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Epsilons used for constant LW value: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific LW used for constant epsilon value: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "The PGD Attacks are also varied by epsilon strengths. It follows the trends in the BIM and CW attacks, where the greater ratio of CNNs to SVMs increase attack efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific epsilon values used: 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.75\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block displays our approach on how we selected our different sets of weak defences and how we evaluated the results. \n"

    "After finishing our testing we had 50 tests with the first 27 tests having more SVMs than CNNs, the 28th test having an even amount, and the last 22 having more CNNs than SVMs. According to our median error rate graph the PGD-ADT had a better error rate until we had a larger portion of CNNs than SVMs. This leads us to believe that using the SVMs with the particular AE’s that we used is not beneficial. \n",

    "\n",

We also used six different sets of hardware for the tests so the data might not be the most accurate / precise. It can be noted though that some of the faster CPUs being used still netted the longer times so that might not be as large of a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Possible Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "The team discussed multiple possible methods that would be interesting to implement for this task given more time to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A genetic algorithm where in x tests were randomly selected y times and the tests that generated the best results from each batch were grouped together for a third run, hopefully ensuring the lowest possible error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Randomizing defenses in such a way that defenses were randomly selected but no more than one defense was selected from each “group”  of defenses (affine, augment, cartoon, compress, denoise, distort, filter, flip, morph, noise, quant, rotate, seg, shift, geo)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Through our testing we’ve found that it’s possible that the accuracy and speed of the weak defenses varies, in some cases by a large amount. It appears that some of the SVM defenses took far longer than the CNN counterparts. Given more time some research could be done to find the optimal ratio between speed and accuracy."
